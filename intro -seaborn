Introduction to Seaborn
Seaborn is a Python library built on top of Matplotlib that makes it easier and prettier to create complex, beautiful visualizations.

Why Seaborn?
Matplotlib is powerful but very low-level.
Seaborn adds high-level features like automatic styling, themes, color palettes, and dataframe integration.
Seaborn comes with built in Datasets
Makes complex plots (like boxplots, violin plots, heatmaps, pairplots) very easy.
In short:

Less code
Better-looking graphs
Easy handling of DataFrames (like from pandas)
Basic Setup
# Install Seaborn if you don't have it
!pip install seaborn
 
# Import Seaborn
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Seaborn Themes
Seaborn automatically makes your plots look good, but you can even control the overall "theme."

sns.set_theme(style="darkgrid")  # Options: whitegrid, dark, white, ticks

Example:

import numpy as np
 
x = np.array([0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ,10, 60])
y = np.sin(x)
 
sns.lineplot(x=x, y=y)
plt.title('Beautiful Line Plot')
plt.show()
